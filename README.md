# Anti AI and Quantum Computer Core Development IDE Platform

## Project Overview

This project integrates AI and quantum computing technologies for a core development IDE platform. The system uses classical AI combined with quantum computing for enhanced problem-solving capabilities.

## Workflow Diagram

    F --> N[One-Sample t-test]
    F --> O[Two-Sample t-test]

### Explanation of Changes:
- The error typically happens when Mermaid cannot recognize a specific syntax or node type. In the corrected version, I ensure that the flowchart syntax is clear and conforms to the supported diagram types.
- You need to ensure that the Mermaid block is properly closed with three backticks (` ```mermaid `) at the beginning and end of the diagram code block.

### How to Apply It:
1. Copy the corrected code.
2. Paste it into your `README.md` file inside your project repository.
3. Commit the changes and push them to your GitHub repository.

### Git Commands:
After updating the `README.md`, use these Git commands:

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Fixed Mermaid diagram syntax"
git push origin main
